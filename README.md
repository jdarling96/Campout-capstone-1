## Project Proposal
  Campout merges modern technology and the great outdoors. Whether you're an amateur adventurer that just moved to a new state or a veteran outdoorsman that is native to your land, Campout lets you find new experiences. Campout is a site that is designed to let users find new campsites in their area as well as recommend users camping spots based on what they like. Utilizing the Active Access Campground API, users are able to find spots within their state that have much larger search criteria for amenities and camping needs. The Campground APIs, backed by Reserve America's database, provides access to campground data for 97% of the US and Canada's national and state/provincial parks. Users will also be able to favorite campsites that are then added to a database. Users will have a dashboard page that includes a profile picture, camping method, favorited campgrounds, and a saved list of spots that peaked their interest. User's accounts will be secured and authentication will be required for multiple routes in the site.Â 




The challenge for this site is working with HTTP responses in XML versus previous projects being in JSON. To send a request for a specific area the request parameters take in long and lat coordinates. I will implement HTML's geo location and will possibly add some calls to googls maps API to get the street addresses of campgrounds.
